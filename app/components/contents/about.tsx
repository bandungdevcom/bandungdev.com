          BandungDev is a tech community for software developers, programmers,
          engineers in Bandung area and around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tech stack focus is quite general ranging from web, mobile, even
          desktop. Can either using any coding languages like HTML and CSS, also
          programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Java,
          Golang, Kotlin, Rust, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore each event or discussion would be either combining different
          topics or focusing on just one tech in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on this idea, BandungDev is being initiated and collaborating
          with various other tech communities and companies such as WPU (aka Web
          Programming UNPAS), Programmer Zaman Now (PZN), GDG Bandung (Google
          Developer Group), JVM Indonesia, Indonesia Belajar, Kelas Terbuka,
          Android Developer Bandung (ADB), BandungPy, BandungJS, ReactJS
          Indonesia, Binary Nusantara, Bearmentor, Catamyst, and much more.
        </p>

          <Anchor href="/telegram">
            BandungDev primary public community group is on Telegram
          </Anchor>{" "}
          that just opened on October 2023, with now more than 1700 members (in
          late December 2023).

        <p>
          Our vision is to collaborate with many other tech and software
          communities in Bandung and around it. Also to inspire other cities to
          build and run their own software developer community. Even BandungDev
          was inspired by{" "}
          <Anchor href="https://surabayadev.org">SurabayaDev</Anchor> which
          already run since a few years ago.
